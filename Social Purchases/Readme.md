### In this exercise, the data contains user information such as userID, age, income, and sex. There's also the target variable, signifying whether they purchased an SUV based on an online ad. The task is to create a support vector classifier capable of predicting web purchases of SUVs based on the data.


#### One of the questions to ask for this exercise are:

##### - Do you need all the data columns to make a prediction? If not, remove them from the data set.
##### - Do you need to encode the data set?
